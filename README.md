2. Link to the dataset (please use this as your data):
data-science-bowl-2018.zip
3. Carry out the whole machine learning workflow for this project (Problem
Formulation →Data Preparation→Model Development→Model
Deployment)
4. For criteria, try to achieve training and validation accuracy of more than 80%
5. Make sure your model is not overfitting.
6. Build a U-Net for this project (for downsampling path, you can apply transfer
learning, then build your own upsampling path similarly as what we did in the
exercise).
